# KodakPi
This is the code used in the Kodak Pi notification lamp project. 

It uses a gmail listener script combined with actions to control the Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT, running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. 

The project is on Instructables at https://www.instructables.com/id/1930s-Kodak-Pi-Notification-Lamp

There's a youtube video of the code in action at https://youtu.be/B_vkmmcb0_M
